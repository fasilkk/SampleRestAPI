# laravel-jenkins

Boilerplate for setting up continuous integration of [Laravel 4](http://www.laravel.com/) using [Jenkins](http://www.jenkins-ci.org)

We did not want to delete and recreate the vendor folder everytime that the script was ran, so "composer update" is ran if the vendor folder exist--otherwise "composer install" is ran.  In order to force a clean vendor folder, you can run one of the builds with the "-clean"â€¦

	ant build-clean
	OR
	ant build-parallel-clean
